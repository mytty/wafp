INTRODUCTION
------------
It is strongly recommended to read the following lines before you use WAFP to generate your own Web Application Finger Prints, because 
the execution of the script in a wrong way could destroy your existing Finger Print Database.


USAGE
-----
The script will be executed via:

./generate_wafp_fingerprint.sh [OPTIONS]


The following list contains the available Options:
--

 APPLICATION_PATH  should be the path to the Web Application files - like the content of the htdocs folder of a wordpress installation.
                   The folder containing the Web Application files must be named like this:
                   APPLICATIONNAME-MAJORVERSION.VERSION.SUB.ASO-RC-ALPHA-BETA
 FINGERPRINT_FILE  is the path to a file containing exported Finger Prints. 
 EXPORT            this means the generated Finger Print data will not be stored within the DB but printed to stdout
                   in a format which can be imported with IMPORT:
 IMPORT            can be used to import some EXPORTED fingerprints.


EXAMPLE USAGE
-------------
                   ./generate_wafp_fingerprint.sh /tmp/wordpress-2.7.1
                       where /tmp/wordpress-2.7.1 holds the extracted wordpress tarball.
                       This will generate the Finger Prints for the provided wordpress version and stores it inside
                       the SQL database.
                   ./generate_wafp_fingerprint.sh /tmp/wordpress-2.7.1 EXPORT > wordpress-2.7.1.fp
                       this will do exactly the same like the first example but it will not store the Finger Print data inside the DB.
                       The Finger Print data is written to STDOUT where it gets redirected to a file called wordpress-2.7.1.fp.
                   ./generate_wafp_fingerprint.sh wordpress-2.7.1.fp IMPORT
                       this will import the Finger Print data contained in wordpress-2.7.1.fp into the sql database.


Now that you know enough about generating WAFP finger prints you should do the following:
touch i_read_README.generate_wafp_fingerprint

After you created the file "i_read_README.generate_wafp_fingerprint" you will be able to execute generate_wafp_fingerprint.sh.
