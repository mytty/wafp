I kindly ask you to submit valuable fingerprints you generated to:
richard.sammet@gmail.com

After I checked those finger Prints I will add them to the database
shipped with WAFP and to the online update system.

please use a subject like: [wafp-fp] wordpress-2.9.1
otherwise I will not be able to locate your Finger Prints in my mailbox ;)

Please also consider to use bzip2 or gzip :)
